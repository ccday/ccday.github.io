			<p><a href="https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view">Phoenix LiveView</a> is an innovative library for the
<a href="https://www.phoenixframework.org">Phoenix Web Framework</a> that enables rich, highly interactive, UI experiences for web
applications. In this article I&rsquo;ll explain why LiveView is an ideal fit for environments with limited bandwidth,
compute capacity, and latency.</p>
<h3 id="the-traditional-single-page-application-spa">The Traditional Single Page Application (SPA)</h3>
<p>Let&rsquo;s begin by reviewing the components of a very common web app architecture today:</p>
<ol>
<li>A frontend written using a JavaScript SPA framework such as React, Vue, Angular, Ember, etc.</li>
<li>A RESTful API, often using JSON over HTTP for serialization and transport</li>
<li>Backend services and stores that implement the domain logic</li>
</ol>
<p>Essentially, we have a layered architecture where the user interface executes on the client (as JavaScript in the
browser). This served as an important evolution from server-side MVC frameworks (such as Rails) which render the UI on
the server then ship HTML to the browser. A primary benefit of moving the UI to the client was greater responsiveness
and interactivity. These frameworks helped to bring the same sort of features previously found in desktop applications
to the web.</p>
<p>However, like anything, there are some trade-offs that come with SPAs. Data-intensive applications will often require
many HTTP requests to the API. This is especially apparent with novel representations (such as graph-based) that split
the data required to assemble a coherent model across many API resources or query results. Other API technologies, such
as GraphQL, try to solve these problems (sometimes known as overfetching or underfetching) by providing a more
sophisticated query language for API resources. However, the data still needs to be sent over the wire.</p>
<p>These problems become especially apparent in the difficult environments that some users, such as many in the
defense community, operate in. Take the following example scenario:</p>
<ul>
<li>The user has a spotty satellite link back to the application servers, with low bandwidth and high latency</li>
<li>The user&rsquo;s browser is running on underpowered hardware, such as a thin client or tablet</li>
<li>The user&rsquo;s browser is outdated and lacks support for the JavaScript functionality required by the application</li>
</ul>
<p>Most SPAs will struggle to maintain a good user experience in this environment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shipping a large JavaScript bundle to the client makes the first load of the application slow</li>
<li>Handling loss of connectivity gracefully while keeping state synchronized is difficult and requires developer expertise</li>
<li>Advanced features implemented in JS will stress the capabilities of underpowered clients or simply fail if not supported</li>
<li>A high volume of requests back to the API will stress available bandwidth and hinder responsiveness</li>
</ul>
<p>So, what&rsquo;s the solution? We could move back to server side frameworks such as Rails, but wouldn&rsquo;t it be nice if we could
keep all of the benefits of the SPA architecture while addressing the problems above?</p>
<h3 id="enter-phoenix-liveview">Enter Phoenix LiveView</h3>
<p>Phoenix is indeed a server-side MVC framework in the same vein as Rails. However, the power of the Elixir language
(and its underlying Erlang BEAM virtual machine) give Phoenix highly performant and scalable real-time capabilities.
LiveView builds on top of these capabilities to bring the same advantages of JavaScript-based SPAs to the server:</p>
<ol>
<li>LiveView maintains a persistent WebSocket connection between each client and the server</li>
<li>When application state changes (e.g. from some user interaction or an update from a backing service) LiveView
computes a minimal diff from the client&rsquo;s current state to the new state and sends that diff over the wire</li>
<li>The client displays the updated state to the user</li>
</ol>
<p>The vast majority of the application logic is executed on the server, on powerful hardware and close to the data. This
eliminates the need to send large JavaScript bundles down to the client. It also greatly reduces the compute
requirements of the client - it pretty much just needs to be able to render HTML. LiveView handles connection failures
out of the box by reconnecting to the server automatically. And finally, and most importantly, because LiveView only
sends diffs of dynamic state, only a minimal amount of bandwidth is required and high latency has less of an impact.</p>
<p>All of these qualities make LiveView ideal for applications that need advanced interactivity and real-time capabilities
and have users in resource constrained and unreliable environments.</p>
